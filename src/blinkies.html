  <p>
    All blinkies/badges on this page come from
    <a href="https://blinkies.cafe">blinkies.cafe</a>, a site you can make your
    own blinkies on. All artistic credits go to them. <br>If you're looking
    into adding our blinkie to your website, first of all, thanks! That's really
    kind of you, even though we
    <b>do not want our work affiliated with any kind of inappropriate content</b
    >. If your site contains that stuff, we'd prefer it if you didn't put our
    blinkie there, thanks!<br><br>To add our blinkie, first of all, download
    it <a class="text-blue-600" href="/img/badge.gif">here</a> for unscaled and
    <a class="text-blue-600" href="/img/badge-3x.gif">here</a> for 3x scaled.
    Next, embed it using this code (or your own): <br>
    <pre class="bg-black text-green-500 p-3"><code>&lt;a href="https://jill-jimmy.com"&gt;
    &lt;img alt="An animated badge for Jill Jimmy" src="/path/to/your/badge.gif"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
